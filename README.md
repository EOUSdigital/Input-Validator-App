# 📕 Module 06 - Loops, Iteration and High Order Array Methods - Lesson 04.02: While and Do While Loops - Challenge


## 📝 Step 6: Input Validator App

🎯 Goal: Use `do...while` to ensure valid input is entered before continuing.

---

### 🧠 Requirements
Simulate input validation for:
1. A name: must not be empty or just whitespace.
2. An age: must be a number and at least 18.
#### Loop until each input is valid using `do...while`.

### 🔁 Pseudocode Prompt
✍️ Please write your pseudocode for this project first.
####  Start with:
- How you will handle the name input loop.
- How you will handle the age input loop.
####  Once I review and confirm it is solid, we will move to your JavaScript implementation!

### ☑️ Pseudocode

```js
SET name
SET age

DO
    PROMPT user to enter name
    PROMPT user to enter age
    CONVERT age to number
WHILE name is empty OR name is only spaces OR age is not a number OR age < 18

PRINT "🎉 Welcome!"
```

### 🧮 Solution

```js
let name;
let age;

do {
    name = prompt("Please enter you name:").trim();
    age = Number(prompt("Please enter your age:"));
} while (name === "" || isNaN(age) || age < 18);

console.log("🎉 Welcome!");
```

### 🔍 Explanation
##### 🔹 name = prompt(...).trim();
- Removes extra spaces (so " " becomes "")
- Makes your name check stricter and cleaner.
##### 🔹 isNaN(age)
- Ensures the user enters an actual number.
##### 🔹 age < 18
- Enforces a minimum age requirement.
